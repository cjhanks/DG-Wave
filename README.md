# DG-Wave

As a part of a job interview, I had to webserver which was capable of
parsing WAV files.

It's *okay*.

I didn't have any reference files for web app building, so I had to
relearn a lot of it.  This was the result, and it is a pretty good
base template for something I might want to build in the future.
